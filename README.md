TODO:
 - Fix red tint (find pixel format which both works and works correctly (right now we use Yâ€²UV420p which works but tints the entire video a reddish hue))
 - Style (make the jFX images a bit more similar to how actual Reddit looks)
 - Improve speech (requires interop with Balabolka (windows) or similar (linux)). This repo is a POC that this can be done in pure JVM.
 - Fiddle around with video bitrate
